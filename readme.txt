== Description ==

the Easy Image Crop (EIC) plugin enables a super intuitive WYSIWYG interface that allows you to crop your images in place, meaning that you are cropping your images in the frontend rather than the backend allowing you to see the result instantly.

Installation is very simple. Just download the plugin, install and active. No code or other customizations needed.

Once installed log in to Wordpress as a user with edit_posts permission and browse you website. The plugin adds a little icon to every image that can be cropped through the interface. For now, any image uploaded to the upload directory can be cropped.
Click the little icon and an overlay with the original image and a resize frame will show. Drag the image around to place it and drag the bottom right corner of the resize box to resize the image. When happy, click the crop icon and you are done! Easy breezy! 

== Installation ==


1. Upload the files included in wbs_eic.zip to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress
3. Done!
4. You can customize the style of the plugin in the Easy Image Crop settings in your Wordpress Admin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Why doesn't my image change when I crop it?

A: Try to enable 'Flush cache when cropping'. This will flush the internal wordpress cache every time you crop an image

Q: I've enabled 'Flush cache when cropping' but my image still hasn't changed. Why??

A: Try to refresh the page after cropping and see if that helps

Q: I've enabled 'Flush cache when cropping' and refreshed the page after cropping but my image still hasn't changed. Why???

A: Go get a cup of coffee or something. I'm sure your freshly cropped image will be on the page if you refresh it when you get back

Q: I've enabled 'Flush cache when cropping', waited 10 minutes before I refreshed the page after cropping but my image still hasn't changed. Why??????

A: If only I new! Please post a comment on the EIC website. Maybe if I buy my wife some flowers she will let me spend even more time on this plugin :)
